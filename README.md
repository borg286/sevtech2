# Seeds

-3503285926045735642	village (east), bone blocks, river, animals, swamp with shoggoth lair, shadow biome all somewhat near spawn point. 

-115227398    Start in AbyssalCraft biome, close village to NW (Another South of that one), nice open area to the east with river biome, large forest and lots of animals. Another village north on other side of tall hills across grassy plains with lots of streaming water..

-8872794606572219902     Spawn next to Laketown (village in middle of lake). High flat mountain at your back for strong star light with a tin vein. On other side of lake large flat area with **large **bone structure VERY nearby, Eucalyptus and a Mulberry tree, 2 coal, 2 copper veins, 1 gold. Lapis on island next to village. Majority of lake is only 1 block deep, making easy access to gravel, salt, sand, and clay. Nearby big hole(y=51 @ base) with Copper cluster. Snow mountain nearby (Build up 20+ blocks on peak for easy access to ceiling of The Beneath).

# Age 0

### Uncategorized Tips

* You can access the main quest guide by pressing L. Purple quests lead you to the end of the age.

* Instead of a Crafting Table, you'll get a Crafting Stump. Place ingredients for the recipe in its grid, and hit it with a rock a few times. I love the way items hop around. Really reinforces the early tech feel of the age.

* If a rock doesn't break in one click, LEAVE IT THERE- it's an ore sample in disguise.

* With an empty hands, you can shift+right click animals, chests, hoppers, and barrels to pick them up and **carry them**. (villagers, horses or adult buffalo cannot be picked up, shift-right click for ½ of a second)

* **Lighting fire on cobblestone** for your first kiln to cook your charcoal will last a bit longer then on dirt/grass. The latter will not finish the cooking process in time before it burns out, and you will find yourself wasting whittling sticks.

* If you found a new item not from Age 0 and you know it's precious, you can use the drop-off button in your inventory or a hopper to put it in a chest

* The world generates in a **logical heat map**. Need snow or a desert? Travel North or South until you find it!

* The carrot in your inventory is where you can view your **nutrition levels**. If you raise the nutrition levels high enough you will get **buffs**. Let them drop too low and you'll have debuffs. See nutrition below for healthy meals below

* You can move **faster** on certain blocks like Grass Paths made by right clicking with a shovel

* Use F7 to see the **light levels** on the ground and F9 to see the **chunk borders**.

* Some blocks are **disguised** as other blocks. They are revealed in the correct stage. Always go back and check out areas you've already explored to see what's new. 

* **Rafts** are an earlier form of water transportation. They are just a bit weaker and slower.

    * Sometimes they sink. Use 'Carry on' (shift+right click) to fetch them.

* Once you've picked a spot for your base and have some food(for regaining your nutrition), pillar up and die to get a **skull compass leading you back to your base**, I mean death point.

* Shift/Sneak on your grave to retrieve your items.

* Keep 4 wolf pelts for creating awesome boots in the next age.

* Once you get a saddle, go tame a horse(repeatedly trying to ride it) to speed up traversing the overworld. He can jump stone fence, but only with you riding. Be sure to bring a fence and lead with you for when you want to get off your high horse. Alternatively live near an ocean and use a raft to visit new places, taking care with the sharks and piranhas that attack when you get to shore. Piranhas jump out at you.

* You can repair your stone tools on the go by crafting it with cobble

* Instead of killing chicken, use Flint Shears to get lots of feathers. Each time they take damage but don't run away.

* If you find a village you can often trade hides for leather so you can skip the leather making process.

* Be on the lookout for Sakura, Eucalyptus or Dark Oak trees. You'll need the logs to upgrade your work stump into the mk2 version. It can hold full stacks of items for repeated crafting, and takes fewer whacks.

* A flint workblade

    * Can be used to instantly cut shrubs and leaves for twine and sticks respectively. 

    * Right-click dirt/wood/stone to make a ladder. Great for animal pens.

        * Takes a random number of tries per block

        * Note you need to be on the side with the ladder else you fall through.

    * Shift-right click wood (logs -- must be upright) to get some bark. Takes a few times of "scraping"

    * Shift-right click on grass path to make grass path stair.

    * Use it in a crafting grid to make many things (press "u" in inventory to see list).

    * Like other flint tools it is not repairable like stone tools are.

    * Makes a good early weapon.

* Venus fly traps also damage mobs. You can craft a ? to serve as a false bridge, tricking mobs to fall into a venus fly trap trap.

* Lit fibre torches(right click unlit one on fire) are not as good as vanilla torches. They only provide a light level of 10, meaning mobs can still spawn 3 blocks away. Craft them into totem torches using 2 sticks for much better lighting. Note they occupy their square so may get in the way  and be placed on the ceiling. Since the totem torch doesn't require charcoal/coal to make you can get and will need a large supply. Use a Flint Workblade to instantly get sticks from leaves and fibre from weeds. Bring 3 workblades with you if you want to stock up.

* The red cedar tree needed for the fire hopper requires a totemic ceremony.

* The flint spear can work like the flint work knife for getting sticks from leaves and fiber from grass, in addition to being a good starting weapon that doesn't break. Just don’t throw it.

* Using spear or any other weapon quickly try to collect as many as possible bear claws (obtainable from any type of bear, easiest are brown bears on swamps). That will allow you to create bear claw paxel which is the best weapon in Stages 0-1 (good amount of damage, very fast attack), it's also a quicker pickaxe/axe/shovel than stone based tools. Can be repaired with bear claws (that’s why you should collect more of them). It’s extremely useful later as a mining tool.

### Totems

When you've decided on a base then make a whittling knife and make 6 high totems. They act like beacons within 13x13x13 (note: zone is a cube, not infinite column). You don't need the totem music for these to function. See rituals below for that. With whittling knife in hand either scroll or right click the air to cycle through the options. 

Start with the totem base on the bottom, and your choice for wood placed on top. All similar totems need to stack on top of each other, ie. 5 wolf totems 1 high only gives strength 1, whereas a 5 high wolf totem gives strength 3.

* Wolf - Strength

* Squid - Water Breathing

* Spider - Spider (treats blocks as if they had ladders)

* Rabbit - Jump Boost

* Pig - Luck

* Ocelot - Creepers don't explode

* Horse - Speed

* Enderman - Night Vision (14 seconds)

* Cow - Slowness and Resistance II

* Buffalo - Haste

* Blaze - Fire Resist (3 second)

* Bat - Bat (no falling damage 1 second)

Put 6x horse and 1x enderman + 1x ocelot throughout your base. Put 6x high wolf and 6x cow on entrances of base to fend off foes.

When hunting for Shadow creatures during a night, carve a totem base and Enderman totem into the nearby trees, so that you have constant night vision.  Add in Horse totems if the area is swampy for speed boost. Or Wolf totems if battling the Shadow Beasts.

When mining underwater for clay, salt, etc. take some wood logs, and make a totem with Squid, Enderman, and Buffalo totems. You'll be able to breathe, see, and mine normally.

### Farming

* While you need to trade bonemeal with the farmer to get farmland for the quest, limit it to once. Craft dirt with bonemeal to get farmland easier.

* Recall that Age 1 opens up the Hoe, so you can keep it small and use bonemeal, and leave the large farm for later. Also, villages often have already hoed ground. Although some of it would already be gone when you get there, the ones with tall grass/other plants on it will still be hoed. Break the plant and immediately plant a seed and the plant won't pop off. You can also attach a plow to the end of a horse and plow the ground before Age 1.

* If you want a large early farm make farmland blocks and a builder's wand for quick construction of a farmland platform on a lake/ocean.

* Use a Flint Workblade to instantly clear out shrubs

* Even flowing water hydrates farmland

* Water is only infinite in River and Ocean biomes.

* Don't bother with a shovel: make a garden trowel instead. When it comes time to bait your fisherman's strainer, you'll be glad you did.

* Scout around for a Giant bone skeleton (simply a bunch of bone blocks lying in a formation) and grind them up to get loads of bonemeal.

* Place a Drum near your farm and do the **Zaphkiel Waltz** for crazy fast plant growth out to a **radius of 6**.

* Focus on wheat seeds and cotton, as growing your animals and string surplus is very important.

* You can throw cotton seed on the ground and it will grow a new cotton plant where the seed drop after a little time. It's a easy way to make big cotton farm without farmland.

### Homesteading

* With an empty hand, you can shift+right click animals to pick them up and carry them. (villagers, horses or adult buffalo cannot be picked up, shift-right click for ½ of a second)

* Fencing animals in a pen

    * Wildberry bushes

    * 2 Dirt makes Dirt slabs. Dig 1 block down and surround pen with slabs

    * Stone fence

* You can get 100% hatching rate with the eggs you picked up by dropping them (not throwing them) and performing the Zaphkiel Waltz.

* Collecting chicken drops can be automated by putting a wooden hopper+chest under a chicken.

* Buffalo can be bred with wheat so you don't have to keep finding cows and doing the ritual

* After you've found a few cows and optionally pigs, explore for a Bone blocks in clusters to get loads of bonemeal to get a fast supply of wheat.

* Before killing your buffalo make a full totem of pig to get fortune 3

* Hide is useful for glue in Age 1. Note: buffalo doesn't melt down into glue, but does make 6 hide.

### Automation

* Place a wood hopper on the opposite side of your chopping block and throw items in to automatically place wood. This works for the stone anvil too.

* Wood hoppers are available early on and you'll need about 10-20 of them for a full automated age 0 and 1 setup. Mark 2 hoppers don’t need a chest to pull from, as you can place up to 4 stacks in the top for queuing. Only mark 2 hoppers can be chained together.

* The grill can take up to 16 items for queuing. For automated extraction wait for Age 1 when you get a Dung Pipe to pull items out the side rather than a fire hopper needing to take the job of heating and pulling.

* Upgrade to the craft stump mk. 2, which takes fewer whacks, and can hold stacks in each slot for quick crafting.

* You'll need ~20 drying racks by the end of Age 1, so might as well make a drying wall.

* When you want to get into beast of burden power be sure to have a 9x9 wall around the 7x7 area each horse/buffalo/llama needs. Use either stone fence, berry bushes or 2 block high wall. Otherwise after the beast is done working he wanders away and breaks the lead.

* Make sure the horse grindstone is on the TOP layer of the 7x7x2 area (put another block under it so it's at eye-level)

* Wolves and buffalo are about the best for running your machine, bested only by fast horses.

* To make beast's work faster place dirt path by right clicking with a shovel on either dirt or grass.

* The press and grindstone are needed much less often than a heavy supply of planks and sticks. Prioritize the chopper with hopper input and extraction. 

* Use storage crates (not to be confused with wooden crate). It can be gathered with all the guts using shift right click. Can be used as a limited version of backpack. Ideal for resource processing or builds. Note that the drop-off button doesn't work with them, so shouldn't be used for primary storage.

### Nutrition

The Nutrition mod encourages you to eat a balanced diet, giving you relevant buffs for eating food. See farming and homesteading for how to get a healthy supply of ingredients.

* To boost nutrition quickly, use the Millstone[BetterWithMods] to become hungry and chow down your surplus of food. You can use multiple cranks to speed this up.

Good foods to make

* Melon Pie(2 watermelon+egg+sugar): **4% Fruit**

* Hearty Stew(Baked Potato+Cooked Meat+5 bowls+4 mushroom+Barley/Wheat flour) cooked in a cauldron: **3.5% Grain Protein and Vegetable**

    * Be careful to only put in the minimum carrots as the cauldron cooks any spare carrots. 

* Pork dinner: Cooked Pork+Baked Potato + raw Carrots gives **3% Vegetable, Protein**

* Tasty Sandwich: Cooked Meat of any kind + Bread gives **3% Grain, Protein**

### Combat

* If playing non-peaceful is too stressful for you, you can switch to peaceful for all but 2 parts and still get into Age 1. You'll need the shadow gem from Abyssal monsters spawning in an Abyssal biome, and also dealing with shoggoths in age 1.

* If you use shears on a creeper, it stops them from exploding.

* Mobs grow in toughness and availability as you progress through the pack

* Attack with a lit torch to set enemies on fire

* A flint workblade is as good as a sword

* A Stone Club is spammable and great against packs of mobs. It is also faster at mining.

* Mud makes for decent early game ranged spammable weapon

* Making a stone-braced wooden shield will make handling darklands combat a lot easier.

* The Stone Axe is the strongest Age 0 weapon.

* Spare Tomahawks auto equips when you throw them, great for killing creepers

* The Totemic whittling knife is available as soon as you open Age 0. Make yourself one, and put down a totem base and an ocelot totem. It has a 5 block in each direction creeper griefing protection. Creepers will not blow up within its range. 

* For on the run buffs focus on nutrition and farming. You can get Speed 3, Strength 1, and Resistance 1, and nourished for healing. Having all 4 nutrition bars up you can get 20 hearts.

* Defeating the Baykok boss from Totemic is highly recommended to do as soon as possible. His behaviour is mostly like that of a standard skeleton so he is easily cheesed by attacking his legs from a 1 block gap. If you can't find parrots that you need to get the eagle-bone whistle, wait until Age 1 and summon a parrot using an abyssalcraft ritual.

* When questing for the shadow gem set up a full 6 tall totem of pig (luck 3), another for horse(speed 3) and another for wolf (strength 3). Add in ocelot (creepers are harmless) and endermen (night vision) totem with only 1 needed of each.

### Inventory tips

* Make shelves instead of chests. They hold 16 items instead of 12, and are more friendly to an inventory wall.

* Craft a backpack when you get access to leather to hold your items (recipe is on page 6 of the backpack recipes past all of the dye-ing recipes).

* After getting a backpack, tech straight to the Stone Backpack for 36 slots. Craft the leather backpack with a wood upgrade, then craft with stone upgrade

* The Cart functions as a double chest when you sneak-right click on it, making by far it the best Age 0 storage option (if bulky).

    * Attach to a horse with astikoor hotkey, R by default

* You can deposit items in your inventory that are already in chests nearby by holding shift and clicking the drop-off button in your inventory. See Dropoff Button here: https://quark.vazkii.us/ This is great after an expedition to clear out things in your inventory you've already found a place for in your chests.

    * You can also store restricted items. Just don't try to select them in your hot bar or inventory.

* The strainer box acts as a normal chest with hopper attached, so you can throw whatever into the water and store it in there.

## Totem Rituals

Totem rituals allow you to make instruments, play a tune before the timer runs out to get various effects. 

Tutorial video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXXumiUuZlw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXXumiUuZlw) 

Start a ritual by shift clicking the instruments in certain orders. After the ritual is started just hit the instruments in the right order.

Each instrument when activating a ritual has a set amount of music it can produce, you need multiple instruments on hand to complete most rituals. Eagle Bone > Jingle Dress = Drum > Rattle = Wind Chime > Flute

The first ritual you should do is the Infused Flute, giving you an infused flute, which makes it randomly perform as well as a drum or rattle or flute each time you play.

Start with the Flute Imbuation ceremony for a stronger flute sound.

You can play the drum with the rattle to activate both instruments at once.

**Place the instrument set near your farm and do the Zaphkiel Waltz ceremony for crazy fast plant growth.**

Get the Jingle Skirt for a significant boost. (costs 3 bones, 3 sugar cane per jingle item!)

Once you get enough bone and sugarcane, make wind chimes and place under leaves (flint/bone shears cuts leaves) to improve their performance. Enough of them can complete the ritual alone.

Hate the rain? Instead of waiting for the Draconic Evolution block or cheating with admin commands, just do the dry ritual. Wonderfully low tech way to shut up that gloomy and loud rain.

# Age 1

This age is focused on Prospecting for Bronze(tin and copper), 2 magic mods: Blood magic and AbyssalCraft, and having a minimal Better With Mods setup.

### What you can do now

* In addition to a crafting table, make a crafting table on a stick.

* Make things quiet with a Soundproofing[Cyclic] needing only a bone block and orange dye.

* Vanilla chests are open so it is time to reorganize your stuff. Recall the drop-off button above can help keep things organized and your personal inventory clean.

* You've unlocked the Hunting Dimension. Use sneak to enter the Hunting Dimension. Creeping moss changes what mobs spawn. Use the above soundproofing block to stop getting scared from the background noise it makes

* You can place water with chisels and bits. Likely to get fixed in the future.

* Aqueducts tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7lRbhtiluw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7lRbhtiluw) 

* Several items like Gears have easier to craft recipes now, be sure to double-check recipes for items from previous ages that were difficult to craft.

* Stone wand lets you build out platforms quickly.

* Replace your horse with Wild Dog Pelt Boots (Speed boost, no fall damage, 2 3 armor)

* A crucible can turn zombie flesh and hide into glue. Useful for making torches throwable, crafting Better with Mods Wooden gears and Slime boots

* Cranks are much cheaper now. Put 3-4 around the grindstone when you can. ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_0.png)

* The AbyssalCraft Crate is silent. 

    * Does not retain items when broken

    * Does not work with Quark item drop off

    * Use storage crates (not to be confused with wooden crate). It's also silent and it can be gathered with all the guts using shift right click. Can be used as a limited version of backpack. Ideal for resource processing or builds. Note that the drop-off button doesn't work with them, so shouldn't be used for primary storage.

### Hunting Dimension

Craft 8 wood with a stone sword to get the portal frame blocks. Make a portal and activate with your sword. This world only spawns selected types of mobs. Entering the portal then **sneak to enter** the Hunting dimension.

Note: Mobs have more health here.

#### Creeping Moss

Creeping moss is a craftable item that allows the player to change the type biome of a chunk in the hunting dimension. Creeping moss can be crafted by surrounding a block of mossy cobblestone (just cobble crafted with vine) with 8 vines, leaves(use flint shears) or saplings. Once you have crafted the creeping moss, you can sneak and right click to set the moss to the biome you are currently standing in. Once the desired biome has been set, you can go into the hunting dimension and right click with moss (without sneaking) to apply the biome changes. Keep in mind that creeping moss can only change the biome of a chunk in the hunting dimension. Also some of the biomes that are harder to find, like ice plains, can be obtained using some special crafting recipes.

* Make a mob grinder by placing a spider + ocelot totem, 1 layer for you to walk, then a wall of fence, with punji sticks the next layer out. The spider totem lets you climb up the walls of your tower![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_1.png)

* Punji sticks (sugar cane) make effective mob killer. They can be placed on the sides of blocks to prevent spiders from climbing over, as [well as hoppers](https://i.imgur.com/VP5pTO9.png) to automate collection

    * TODO: how to deal with damaged items.

* If breeding a bunch of animals for pelts isn't your thing you can AFK and Farm for quite a bit of zombie flesh, melt it down to blood (16 flesh per block) and get some slime boots.

### Prospecting

* Having trouble finding ore? If you have a desert nearby, every stone you find on surface is a ore cluster. Mine it with a pickaxe to get the underlying cluster. Find the center of the chunk and dig down.

* Every ground stone in a desert is an ore sample. Remember that deserts are south.

* The Ore is setup in large veins, think 16x16ish. Locate the chunk a vein is in by finding a Sample on the surface. F9 to see the chunk borders. Use the prospectors ore and right click on a block. If an interesting ore is within 32 blocks straight down, then the prospector's tool tells you how many it encountered along that path. Mine in that direction and prospect around to hone in on where the ore is. 

* Make a 6 high **buffalo totem** when you find the vein to get **haste 3.**

* To make Tin, Copper, and Bronze you can either make a porcelain melter or a seared melter, the former is easier. You need to pour them into either type of casting basin, then use the stone anvil to get ingots. These melters don't make alloys and can be automated with hoppers, to the point of only manual activation of the faucet.

* Place a hopper above the stone anvil to automate placing ingots.

* Bronze leggings give armor 5 over leather's 2. But bronze chestplate has diminishing returns, only improving leather’s 3 to a mere 4.

### Automation

* A dung pipe can pull out items from the side and drops them as items. Use this on a grill instead of a Flame hopper. Just have the dung pipe drop items into a wooden hopper.

* Make a hoe, plant a garden. Remember the worms you find will die, so the hydration they provide is temporary.

    * **Prioritize Cotton** **(string) and hemp (Hemp Fiber) and carrots(growing pig army)**

#### Ore processing

We can automate the processing of our metals by periodically giving a redstone signal to the faucet on our melter. While we don't have access to redstone dust, per se, we do have a wooden weight sensor and a wandering chicken. Put a platform on the sensor on the faucet, and build up a little cage for a chicken. Obviously put a hopper under the casting basin to automate extraction, and a hopper feeding clusters into the melter. While you can’t do as much fine tuning, it gets the job done. We’ll get a chunk loader in a later age. 

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_2.png)

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_3.png)

(u/rtahkwa here, same submitter as the trick above) At the same technology level a dependable clock can be created using the turntable.  Put a block on the (working) turntable, attach a lever to it.  Activate the lever.  Then make sure the faucet is on the other side of the lever.  The rotation of the turntable will send a pulse to the faucet.  Select the wanted speed by right clicking the turntable with an empty hand.  There are four sides, so a single turntable can cycle four smelters/spigots.  (I'll add a screenshot of a full setup later)

In the picture below, the turntable rotates the switch so all four melters are emptieds automatically.  On top of the windmill's gearbox is a bamboo chime.  This block will emit a redstone signal when it rains, making sure the gearbox doesn’t get damaged. is a dead man’s switch in case it rains.  It’s an empty barrel on top of a wooden weight sensor.  When it starts to rain, the barrel will fill with water.  The weight sensor will then disconnect the gearbox so it doesn’t get damaged.  After it stops raining, you can climb to the top and manually empty the barrel with the connected faucet.  Under the faucet there are casting channels guiding the water into a barrel at floor level.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_4.png)

### Blood magic

Blood magic mod is based on Life Points earned through sacrifice by blood. Initially you'll use your own HP to power it, and if you continue further into Blood Magic you can set up animal grinders.

* After crafting the Blood Altar make a sacrifice dagger and stab yourself to fill altar with blood.

* You can put rotten flesh in the Melter to get liquid blood, 16 rotten flesh gives you a block which crafts into 4 blood balls. This is helpful bootstrapping in to Blood Magic as you don't need to create a full smeltery to stand in.

* When crafting the blank runes to upgrade the blood altar, the weak blood orbs don't get consumed when crafting. So you only need one block of congealed blood.

* Place the 8 blank runes 1 block lower than the altar and around it. This makes a tier 2 alter.

* If you want to continue further in Blood Magic follow the steps in this [lets player's video](https://youtu.be/Q0GNRxIy-1Y?t=27m57s)

### AbyssalCraft

AbyssalCraft is a large mod opening 4 dimensions, growing knowledge about the great old gods. As you progress through the mod item's names will unlock. Its power source is received from statues that direct power into firstly your necronomicon, then later you can store it into containers.

* First and easiest is finding an abyssal biome and killing shadow monsters for the gem shards.

    * To make farming these gem shards easier bring wood for 3-4 totems, each 6 tall.

    * You can also use your hunting dimension with some creeping moss to quickly access an Abyssal biome.

* Next and hardest is finding and farming a Shoggoth lair. They seem more likely around river biomes.![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_5.png)

* They seem to climb similar to spiders. They don't deposit their sludge on bottom half slabs or string. They require a 3x3 hallways to move. However a bunch of them can shove one into a 2x3 hallway. If you are quick you can build a wall right at the bottom of the stairs leading into their lair before they manage to escape. You will get hit at least once since they can hit through a 1 block thick wall but focus on establishing a wall first and pretty it up later. You can build a 3x3 killing chamber at the top of your wall. Use bottom half slabs for the floor and don't bust the wall leading to the lair until your ready for them to come through. Opposite of the wall you can build a 2 block thick wall with a 1 block high slit to slash at them through it. To collect the drop swing underneath and bust out one slab, replace it and repeat until you have all the drops. Mk2 hoppers can suck the items through the slabs for a much safer alternative.

As long as you don't go in far enough to attract the attention of the Shoggoth in the back, you should have a endless supply of them. My first attempt I went for a killing hole in the floor and it didn't work out very well since that angered all of them which meant no new Shoggoth could spawn after they were all dealt with.

Punji sticks don't work on them since they climb walls. Lighting them on fire with fiber torches is very slow. Slashing them is slow and consumes roughly 6 swords to get 1 stack of their drops. 

* Video tutorial on finding and dealing with Shoggoth: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mORTlnKoqHQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mORTlnKoqHQ) 

    * Alternatively you can mine out a 1 block wide path into their spawn area and then make room behind you for 3 totems, 6 high pig for luck, 6 high wolf for strength, and 6 high cow for resistance, and 1 high endermen. Combine with bronze leggings and any available armor and you should be able to withstand their heavy blows.

    * Their hitbox is small and closer to the back of their skull. I guess this was to say the only way to deal with them is to out-smart them, namely by attacking their intelligence directly.

* After crafting the statue place it **away from your base** and hold the necronomicon. The statue will send power into your necronomicon at 5 PE / 5 seconds taking about 15 minutes to get the 1000 needed. Randomly you may get struck by lightning and even explosive lightning, and sometimes wither effect. After getting 1000 points that area will have gotten tainted and will produce abyssal mobs. A shovel can quickly turn it into grass path.

* The negative effects increase with how much charge is in the necronomicon.

* To find Corallium look around for a biome looking like this or at least 40 ground level or below and then use a Weak Dowsing rod until it reports with finding Corralium. ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_6.png)

* Regarding Corallium, You do not *need *to find the Corallium biome, they spawn, albeit rarely in Swamp and Ocean biomes. Strip mining such is a slow but surefire way to get early Corallium.

### The Beneath

Your goal is to get a handful of Black Quartz (for actually additions) and Aquamarine (for Astral Sorcery)

* While the Melter can't alloy tin and copper, you can use the kiln to get bronze, then melt it down, and pour into a block.

* Darkness in the beneath hurts, so take a couple stacks of torches. Recall that coal doesn't spawn everywhere, and for every charcoal you take bring equal twine. Alternatively take a flint workblade to shrubs and leaves to get loads of twine and sticks. Craft fibre torches, light them, then craft with 2 sticks to make Totem torches, ie. bypassing charcoal altogether.

* Your "Beneath" teleporter can be moved. Either dig down or pillar up before placing and entering the Beneath. See next note to know when to stop.

    * It is better to pillar up in the Overworld rather than the beneath as spirits can push you off ladders and pillars.

    * Remember to use cobblestone for your pillar as you can use a Flint Workblade to carve out a ladder when you climb back up. Obviously you can drop into water for a quick decent.

* Black Quartz can be found from y = 2 to y = 20, Aquamarine can be found from y = 150 to y = 246 

* Before digging to a set Y area dig up till you see a cave. On the top of the caves you have a good chance of finding a few patches of ores. Aquamarine comes in veins of 12.

* You can get throwable torches by crafting 8 regular torches with glue. This is great for handling dungeons and areas with spawners.

* Place your beneath teleporter on top of the ground as you get teleported to the same y level and is on top of a platform in the other dimension

* When you first get into the beneath, mark your spot, because it is a pain finding your way home

* You can speed down a strip mine by running and jumping the whole way

* 11 Black quartz can be used to make black quartz AIOT

    * It is all the tools combined and the best age 1 weapon. 

    * Has **1100 durability**

    * **Can be repaired** with 3 Black quartz, a real bargain!

* Upgrade your chestplate and helmet to black quartz, and if you didn't get Bronze leggings, upgrade those too.

* Don't convert all of your Crushed Black Quartz into Black Quartz.  You’ll need some of the dusts later to create Black Iron Ingots.

### Better With Mods

Before we get into Astral Sorcery we need a Saw to get the bark off of Mulberry wood.  Here is what a Mulberry tree looks like: ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_7.png)

After making the Saw you'll need to get started on the water wheel, as the hand crank doesn’t work on the saw. You’ll need ~36 hemp. Use Flint shears to get the hemp plant but leave the base planted. Or just use a half stack of bonemeal. Know that breaking the hemp plant in the bone mealed state has 100% of dropping 1 seed and 0% chance of 2 seeds. (Or take advantage of Totemic "Zaphkiel Waltz" Ceremony)

Follow the main quest Guide to a waterwheel and gearbox and make 3 wooden axles (1 for the water wheel to be based on, 1 to connect to the gearbox, and one to deliver power to the saw

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_8.png)

You can tell the gearbox and axle are connected right by seeing the axle turn

Making a 4th axle allows the millstone (power must come from bottom of millstone) to be powered here instead of by hand.

Because Better With Mods annoyingly drop all products, wooden hoppers are your friend.

Completing the saw also makes Wooden gears much cheaper.

### Astral Sorcery beginnings

Astral sorcery is based on star light feeding into bigger and bigger altars and actual star gazing. Getting the luminous crafting table opens the next age. This mod is gated on aquamarine whis is configured to come only from the top of the Beneath world, and Mulberry bark which can only be scraped off with a Better with Mods Saw, and a Necronomicon Ritual taking 1000 PE (waiting in front of statue with book in hand for 15 minutes, or with a Energy Pedestal).

* Need bronze tier pickaxe to pick up the luminous crafting table.

* The meat of astral sorcery is covered in [Age 2: Astral Sorcery](#heading=h.q8tahli9nh0b)

# Age 2

### What you can do now

* Tinker's Crafting Station

* Boat

* Books

* Slime Sling, and obviously the Slime boots you had available in age 1, so you don't die from flinging yourself

* Quartz Grindstone[Applied Energistics 2]

* Framed Storage Drawer

* Mine Iron, Gold, Lapis

* Ranged weapon, See Tinkers construct right below

* TODO: See if the other crafting table on a stick retains it's inventory.

### Things to look out for

* If you see an Enderman you should absolutely try to kill him. If you can you should make a Luck 3 totem pole as well. Ender pearls are important.

### Tinkers Construct

Note: Blank patterns require Sidings from the Saw instead of sticks.

Tinkers tools are split between parts that require pouring liquid metal into a cast and those that do not. This section focuses on what you can get without casts.

* Make sure the pattern chest is touching both the pattern table and the part builder, otherwise you have to access it by clicking on the pattern chest tab.

* The crafting station is the block that allows the rest to be accessed as tabs in one UI.

* You can make **casts by Melting clay**, pouring over stone part, melting metal, and pouring into clay cast, consuming the cast in the process

* Best bow

    * Wood bows have nerfed durability, so green slime arms are the way to go. 

        * Get **green slime crystals **by taking either glue or blood balls and crafting a slime cube -> green slime balls + dirt, sand --furnace-> green slime crystal (no cast needed)

    * Damage arrows (**3.67 hearts** average observed, 50 arrows): **Bone **arrowhead, reed shaft, feather fletching

    * Endurance arrows (1.9 hearts average observed, **170 arrows**): Green slime crystal arrow head, reed shaft, feather fletching

* Melee: A bone and flint mattock with bone handle does **as much damage as a diamond sword**

#### [Optional] Tool Forge

You can make a Tool forge by burning grout into seared stone and 4 tin/copper blocks.

* Bronze is the only liquid metal worth making casts for at the moment.

* Stone on the other hand, doesn't require casts, and can be repaired easily. Recall parts can be swapped out when you get a full smeltery for better parts.

* Make a **Stone Hammer** and Stone Lumber Axe for quick mining and felling

* Shuriken: The upper left-hand corner determines what material repairs it.

    * 3 hearts average observed, **107 ammo**: 1 Bone in upper left, 3 slime. Repairs with bonemeal, marginally less damage than bone and cactus shuriken, but way more ammo

### Getting Iron

Iron is now open, but your melter isn't going to get hot enough. In addition to tracking it down and mining it, you’ll need lava and the crystal from the Between Lands to make the smeltery controller

#### Handling lava

Before venturing out to find Hematite, make a couple Seared Tanks or Seared Gauges.

Pick one of the following for holding lava:

*  As many clay buckets as lava you need

* A Between lands Bucket![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_9.png) made from Syrmorite holds lava

* Wood Barrels can hold up to 8000mb of Lava and can be shift-right clicked to store in your inventory. Lava will burn the barrel if left in the Overworld. It will also burn you if you stand next to the burning barrel (oops).

#### Hematite

* A 6 high buffalo gives you haste 3.

* If you got a Tinker's stone hammer, you can speed up mining Hematite by placing cobble and mining that.![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_10.png)

* You can melt iron by reconfiguring your melter to be heated by a Seared Gauge. Note the automation section above to automate the faucet.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_11.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_12.png)

* If you have 3 gold, make a stone bucket, place in a table and pour gold to make a cast. Pouring 3 iron gives you a bucket.

### The Between Lands

Before we can get to Iron, we need to take the side quest of the Between Lands. Because it has its own wood and tool tech tree, you'll need to start from roughly scratch.

Goal: Obtaining a Aqua Middle gem found in Sludge Plains lakes

* The druids spawn when you enter the ritual area, giving you time to prep before the battle.

* Take the time to get slime boots when fighting the Druids. It turns their offensive spell against them. Alternatively make a Bat totem pole (along with Pig for luck) near the circle where you are fighting them.

* The Betweenlands is a very large mod, consult [http://the-betweenlands.wikia.com/wiki/Basic_Guide_to_Survival](http://the-betweenlands.wikia.com/wiki/Basic_Guide_to_Survival) for some starting tips.

* Take neither food, Potions, bedding, Vanilla Torches nor weapons (overland diamond < between wood sword)

* Totem torches work normally in the Between lands

* Find Bushes to get Weedwood sticks. The SevTech recipe killed weedwood planks -> weedwood sticks

* ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_13.png)

* Hunt down a Weedwood tree and make base in it ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_14.png)

* Instead of making 2 Sulfur furnaces, craft a single one with 8 betweenstone for a double furnace.

* Your spawnpoint in the Betweenlands is not set when you enter through a portal. So setting your spawn should be high priority. The first thing to make with your Syrmorite ingots is shears, to get moss, to get a moss bed and set your spawnpoint.

* Food is hard. Cook Swamp Reed ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_15.png) into donuts for 6 hunger bars.

* Be on the lookout for Syrmorite ingots![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_16.png) in pots![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_17.png) inside Fortresses to get early access to lava-capable Syrmorite Bucket![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_18.png).

* To make a full smeltery, you will need to go to the Betweenlands and find a Aqua Middle Gem. To find it easily craft a betweenlands boat and row around until you find one, they glow in the dark and the boat bugs the water texture to be see-through. Remember to take a bucket of swamp water with you. The purifier needs it and the normal fuel to run.

#### Tinkers Construct Smeltery

Prerequisite: Turntable[Better with mods], Aqua Middle gem[Betweenlands]

* A bucket cast is made from a stone bucket, not a clay one. You still need a clay bucket to get lava for the melter.

* You can make casts out of Gold, Brass, or Aluminum brass(1 copper+3 aluminium). Seems you only have access to gold right now.

* A tinkers smeltery can be as small a base of 1 square.

* Smelteries can share sides, but not the tank nor controller. This helps avoid unwanted alloys.

* Note: **Obsidian doesn't form** in the smeltery, so you won’t have quick and easy access to Obsidian yet.If a rock doesn't break in one click, LEAVE IT THERE- it's an ore sample in disguise.

### Twilight Forest

The portal to the twilight forest is built in the same way as usual, because you do not have access to diamonds it is opened with a Starmetal Ingot.

Ore veins spawn in the Twilight Forest, and due to the dimension's lower surface height can be a lot easier to reach, or in some cases even be found right at the surface.

Hedge Mazes may contain a hostile wolf spawner, which if left intact may provide you with an easy source of pelts to craft into leather or glue if you have not yet started breeding animals at this point.

Medium and large hollow hills, as well as hydra lairs contain Redstone Ore, as well as Coal, Iron, Gold, and Lapis.

Maze wafers are a decent source of grain nutrients and can be found in Labyrinths and other dungeons later in the progression.

Dark Towers have plenty of useful items to loot, including Brewing Stands, Anvils, and Pistons, as well as the Carminite Reactor you will need at the end of this age, in addition to this there will be plenty of spawners that will spawn carminite ghasts which you can kill for ghast tears, and there are a lot of chests to loot for other goodies like Redstone Lamps, glowstone dust, and a lot of protein food (Experiment 115).

If you want to harvest any of the Low Grade Charcoal blocks, do so before entering the next age as this will cause them to turn into netherrack.

Dark Towers also can contain Blaze spawners, though Blazes don't actually seem to spawn in age 2. 

### Astral sorcery

* Star light increases with Y level, up to 120. Higher than that doesn't matter. Once you get more advanced alters this benefit doesn't matter.

* Wait till night to find a spot open to the sky. Each chunk has its own star light levels.

* Need bronze tier pickaxe to pick up the luminous crafting table

* Mischief of Mice's [top tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i22YPsbfego) and a [playlist of astral sorcery - bit by bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uU67eYK_Mc&list=PLQzDSnrhrcyyZKmHp1zdj03jRbuZN7NOh)

* TODO: insert picture of a rock crystal sample.

* When making a crystal grow by soaking it in starlight, if you continue past the maximum purity there is a decent chance that a second crystal will form with higher purity (this is also the only way to increase purity). See [here](https://youtu.be/i22YPsbfego?t=5m23s) for example

* You ALWAYS want to use perfect crystals for rituals and collector crystals, and preferably celestial crystals

* For the most part ones with poor stats are garbage and only really useful in lightwells and things that don't care about quality (which you can tell by checking if the output item has stats in the tooltip, eg. Mantle of Stars or Altars do not care about crystal stats as a part of their crafting component)

* Rock Crystal ore is not mineable with a stone pickaxe, you need something with mining level diamond to harvest it (like an iron or bronze pickaxe from tinkers).

* In regards to starlight generation: Aquamarine < Resonant Aquamarine < Rock Crystal < Celestial Crystal < Attuned Rock Crystal < Attuned Celestial Crystal

# Age 3

**Ores:**

**Tools:**

**Key Items:**

### Astral Sorcery

* Don't waste time on a Mineralis ritual yet, it’s been reported and the configs need to be altered so it doesn’t break pack progression, same goes with Aevitas perk

### Filtered Hopper

* When turning into hellfire dust be careful can spawn ghast.

# Age 4

**Ores:** Assorted Quartz (affected by Fortune)

**Tools:**

**Key Items:**

# Age 5 

* Progression is currently (as of SevTech 3.0.4) broken to get to Stage 5 due to:
	1) Incorrect staging of GalactiCraft Oxygen Fan (affecting Oxygen Collector craftability)

Fix: Oxygen fan has kept its original recipe, so you can trade materials for that, an issue is the wafers portion of the Oxygen Fan recipe

2) Invalid rocket fuel recipe as it uses mekanism liquid oxygen instead of GC oxygen

Temporary Fix: Darkosto has recently added a recipe that makes GC Fuel with 250mb of GC Oxygen and 100mb of Kerosene (same proportions as the Mek Liquid Oxygen recipe already added, so you can just void materials in proper ratio to get your own Fuel, there is no non-creative fix
